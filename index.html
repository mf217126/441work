    <p> This is a page showing the homework done for Web Technologies. It is experimental, and will probably change over the course of the semester. </p>
    <h2> Hello! </h2>
    <p> Hi, my name is Mariah Forbes, and I am making this website for my 441 class at the University of Montana! </p>
    <p> I am a Media Arts major and am currently in the Animation BFA. </p>
    <p> Besides Media Arts, I am minoring in Geosciences. I also enjoy drawing and writing and can play a little guitar.</p>
    <p> I was born and raised in Montana, and I think it has the most gorgeous scenery of all the states (though I might be a bit prejudiced. :)).</p>
    <h2> Homework: </h2>
    <div class = "homeworkstyle">
      <h3> Homework 1: </h3>
      <p> My first homework is to make a responsive webpage. Does it work?<p>
