# Homework 2
With this homework I created a timer as well as a button that counted down. I didn't realize we were supposed to just have it count down once the page loaded until after I'd already added the button.
## The timer
It took me a while to figure out how to display the numbers, even if I **did** have the timer in there. I switched the numbers of the timer to count **down** rather than add to the numbers, and I then printed it by making a getElementById variable called "print" that allowed me to print the numbers to the screen. I made the intervals fairly short to get the countdown approximately within five seconds.
## The colors
The colors were easy to add, all things considered. Instead of "time's up" at the end, however, I added "boom!". It was another thing I didn't notice until I'd already finished coding my page.
