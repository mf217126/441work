# Homework 1
## Learning
In this homework, I learned a lot about ways to resize the screen and its contents. First, I learned I could create classes in html by using the style tag. I could then use those styles within the html to make different "sections." I also re-learned how to post a picture. I did this by looking up W3, because it's been a while since I've used html.
## Applying
I made two classes, just to try to divide the page up a little better. The first I put in a div around the contents of the body (but inside the body tag). The second class worked like a charm and I'm happy with how it turned out. Later I might make it look better in css.
I also was able to make a responsive page by making the width (defined in the meta) as a function of the with of the window, or *device-width*. I also messed around a little with the *initial-scale*, but I decided to leave it alone. I wrote up some information about myself, and put in a jpeg of something I've made. I had to mess around with it for a while before I discovered all I had to do was set the image width to *100%* and the height to *auto*.
