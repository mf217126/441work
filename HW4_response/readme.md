#Homework 4 Response
In this homework I used js in node.js to print stuff to the console, I allowed users to input information using flags in anoter js, and finally created a calculator to calculate parts of the fibonacci sequence under the value of 80.
## Part 1: PRINTING
This part was easy. I was able to print some words using console.log().
## Part 2: FLAGS PRINTING
This part was also fairly easy. I used console.log() to define flags and allow the user to see a message that was typed.
## Part 3: FIBONACCI SEQUENCE
This part was fairly difficult. It took me a while to figure out what was wrong with it, which ended up being the fact that I was calling the wrong thing when I went to print the answer. I finally figured out I had to call the fibonacci function in my console log in order for it to work rather than something else.
