   <p> Welcome to Myville, where anything is possible! There are so many choices to be made, so many ways this could go right…or go wrong. You’re starting a new career here, in a new home, and all you have now is a bike and a cruddy little apartment. Oh, and $100 of money left over after rent, appliances, and food bills have been paid for the month.
You decide to get out and explore the town you’re in. What do you choose to do? </p>

The neighborhood really isn’t that bad; not once you look past the crumbling walls and rusted pickups sitting on cinderblocks; old auto projects that the owners never got around to finishing. There are trees and vines up all over the place, and although the yards are ill-tended and house rocky soil, at least there is some green, so that isn’t so bad. You hear a rustling in some currant bushes as you pass by. What do you do?"> Walk </button>
